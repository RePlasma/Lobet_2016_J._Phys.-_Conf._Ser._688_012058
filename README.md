Abstract: _Next generation of ultra-intense laser facilities will lead to novel physical conditions ruled by collective and quantum electrodynamics effects, such as synchrotron-like emission of high-energy photons and e+e- pair generation. In view of the future experiments performed in this regime, the latter processes have been implemented into the particle-in-cell code CALDER._

In this notebook we (approximately) reproduce some of the figures in the paper.
